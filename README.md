📘 Project Title: Impact of Higher Education on Economic Growth in the UK  
📍 Course: Econometrics (EPE2313), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  
📅 Semester: [12] 2024  
🧠 Project Type: Group Coursework (Grade: A)
This project investigates the impact of higher education levels on the UK's economic growth from a time-series perspective.  
Using EViews, we conducted an OLS regression analysis with key macroeconomic variables such as household consumption, investment, government expenditure, and trade openness as control variables.

👥 My Key Contributions:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned 100% of missing values using `na` commands in EViews.  
- **Regression Analysis:** Designed and ran the OLS model:  
  > ln GNI = β0 + β1 ln HL + β2 ln INV + β3 ln HC + β4 ln GE + β5 ln Open + ε  
- **Diagnostic Tests:**  
  > - Multicollinearity (VIF)  
  > - White Heteroskedasticity Test  
  > - Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation Test  
- **Report Authoring:**  
  > - Sole author of pp.12–18 (Methodology & Results)  
  > - Created Figures 2–8 (pp.5–10)

🔍 Key Insights:

- Higher education (HL) shows a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth (GNI), with strong R-squared and robust diagnostics.
- This project strengthened my skills in EViews, model interpretation, and collaborative report writing in English.

📌 *Note:* I independently handled all data cleaning, regression, and statistical testing. Please refer to figures and appendix for authored sections.
